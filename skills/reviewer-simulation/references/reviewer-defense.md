# Reviewer Defense Methodology

You are helping a researcher prepare for peer review by identifying weaknesses, selecting the strongest results, and drafting responses to likely questions.

## Step 1: Vulnerability Analysis

Read the paper and identify weaknesses from a reviewer's perspective:

### Technical Weaknesses
- Missing baselines that reviewers would expect
- Evaluation metrics that don't fully capture the contribution
- Assumptions stated without justification
- Scalability concerns not addressed
- Missing error analysis or failure case discussion

### Presentation Weaknesses
- Claims stronger than evidence supports
- Missing related work that a reviewer in the area would know
- Unclear methodology (could someone reimplement from the paper alone?)
- Figures that don't clearly convey the intended message
- Inconsistencies between sections

### Experimental Weaknesses
- Small dataset size without justification
- Missing statistical significance tests
- No comparison with state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks
- Hyperparameter sensitivity not explored
- No computational cost comparison

## Step 2: Venue-Specific Anticipation

Different venues have different review cultures:

**Top-tier ML/CV conferences (CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, ECCV)**:
- Expect extensive ablation studies
- Strong baseline comparisons required
- Novelty must be clearly articulated
- Reproducibility is valued

**Workshops**:
- More tolerant of work-in-progress
- Interesting ideas valued over exhaustive evaluation
- Novel applications of existing methods are acceptable

**Journals**:
- Expect thorough related work discussion
- Deeper analysis and more experiments than conferences
- Writing quality and organization matter more

## Step 3: Question Generation

Generate likely reviewer questions, ranked by probability:

For each question:
1. **The question** — phrased as a reviewer would write it
2. **Why they'd ask** — what triggers this concern
3. **Can existing data answer it?** — yes (point to specific data) or no (new experiment needed)
4. **Draft response** — if answerable, write a concise response

Template:
```
Q: [Reviewer question]
Motivation: [Why this would be asked]
Answerable: [Yes — cite Table X / No — would need experiment Y]
Draft response: [If answerable, 2-3 sentences]
```

Generate at least 10 questions, prioritized by likelihood.

## Step 4: Ablation Selection

From all available experiments, select the subset that:

1. **Proves the core contribution** — the single most important ablation
2. **Shows each component's value** — incremental additions showing improvement
3. **Addresses anticipated weaknesses** — preemptively answers likely questions
4. **Tells a coherent story** — the progression makes narrative sense

Ranking criteria for each ablation:
- **Impact magnitude**: how much does it change the primary metric?
- **Narrative strength**: does it clearly support a specific claim?
- **Uniqueness**: does it show something no other ablation shows?
- **Cost**: main paper vs appendix (based on space constraints)

## Step 5: Negative Results

Negative results are valuable when properly framed:

- "We explored X but found it did not improve over Y because Z"
- This shows thoroughness and provides insight
- Frame as "analysis" not "failure"
- Include in supplementary if not in main paper

## Step 6: Rebuttal Preparation

If responding to actual reviews:

1. **Read ALL reviews** before responding to any
2. **Identify common concerns** across reviewers
3. **Prioritize**: address factual errors first, then major concerns, then minor ones
4. **Be respectful**: thank reviewers, acknowledge valid points
5. **Be specific**: point to exact sections, tables, figures
6. **New experiments**: only promise what you can deliver in the rebuttal period

Rebuttal structure per reviewer:
```
We thank Reviewer X for their thoughtful feedback.

**[Major concern]**: [Direct response with evidence]

**[Specific question]**: [Concrete answer]

**[Suggestion]**: [How we will incorporate it]
```

## Output Format

Produce:
1. **Weakness table**: categorized weaknesses with severity
2. **Top 10 anticipated questions**: with answerability and draft responses
3. **Recommended ablation subset**: with justification for each
4. **Suggested text edits**: specific paragraphs to strengthen before submission
